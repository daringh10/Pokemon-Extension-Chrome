https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-pokemon-search/ekakjiiieloliofkoolkfndchibppbha/related

A quick and easy pokemon search using PokeApi. Facilitates getting information quick

Notes:
 - The autocomplete feature is entirley custom and uses no external libray
 - Only works for  gen 1, this was my first time ever using javascript
 - I plan on making an actual usable version in the future.
